# dice-interview-question

This was a technical interview challenge that I got. I didn't have time to finish during the interview so I wanted to learn from the challenge and complete it to the best of my ability.

## The Challenge

On button click change the dice face (CSS) according to a number (1-6).

## What I learned

The challenge was given to me with a single div (dice), a single button, and some starter CSS. I was nervous and for some reason my brain decided I could ONLY use JS to complete the challenge which wasn't actually part of the challenge. So, my original plan of action wasn't even considering that the display would need to dynamically change.

While working through my solution, I added more divs (pips) to my HTML doc then used CSS Grid to specify where each div (pip) would appear/be housed.

In JS I managed the visibility of each pip as well as resetting the dice face to default and generating a random number between 1-6.

This was pretttttyyy fun, give it a shot!
